# Cognitive Automobile Laboratory
This is an excellent [course project](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/lehre_SS_Kognitive_Automobile_Labor.php) from [MRT](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/index.php) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, focusing on implementation of algorithms for autonomous driving.<br/><br/>

## Important Packages from Team KITAF

### kitaf_detector_ros_tool
Detection of traffic signs and other vehicles based on TensorFlow and [SSD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf) neural network.<br/>
Our result is pretty impressive, which is capable of detecting traffic signs in real time with an accuracy above 96%.<br/>

### kitaf_lateral_control_ros_tool
Controlling the vehicle based on [stanley controller](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2009/2/Automatic_Steering_Methods_for_Autonomous_Automobile_Path_Tracking.pdf).<br/>
We first use kinematic model for its easy implementation, and then move to dynamic model for better performance.

### map_creation_ros_tool, kitaf_navigation_ros_tool
- Generating an [occupancy grid](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf) map based on point cloud from kinect2. With local grid maps from each time step, we maintain a global grid map with bayes updating rule.
- Providing path when driving along the road. Use [potential field](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~hsafad/robotics/) method based on occupancy grid to plan a path for going throungh the unknown environment with pylons.

### kitaf_following_ros_tool
Control our vehicle to follow another vehicle based on detection results and point clouds.
